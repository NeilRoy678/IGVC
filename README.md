The Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) project was designed as part of a university team project where we developed an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating and responding to dynamic environments. The vehicle was tasked with performing lane detection, pothole detection, and lane adjustments, all integrated into a robust autonomous system using ROS (Robot Operating System).
Project Highlights

    Vision Algorithms for Lane Detection: Developed advanced vision algorithms, including inverse perspective mapping, to detect lanes on the road. These algorithms enabled the vehicle to perceive and track the lane markings, providing accurate positioning for the vehicle's path.

    Automated Lane Adjustment: Integrated the lane detection system with a PID controller to automate lane adjustments. This allowed the vehicle to follow the path accurately without requiring manual intervention.

    Pothole Detection using Machine Learning: Implemented a machine learning model for pothole detection, which was simulated and tested within ROS. The system was trained to recognize road anomalies and make decisions on how to avoid or navigate over them safely.

    Cost Reduction through Sensor Integration: Optimized the vehicle by replacing the conventional LiDAR sensors with vision-based algorithms, such as Gaussian Potential Field, for obstacle detection. This significantly reduced the overall project cost while maintaining high accuracy.

Key Technologies

    Robot Operating System (ROS): ROS provided the framework for integrating various subsystems and algorithms, including vision processing, control, and sensor data handling.

    Computer Vision: Utilized computer vision techniques, including inverse perspective mapping, for lane detection and obstacle avoidance.

    Machine Learning: Implemented machine learning for pothole detection to enhance the vehicle's ability to understand and respond to real-world environments.

    PID Control: The PID control algorithm was used to adjust the vehicle's path, maintaining it within the designated lane.
